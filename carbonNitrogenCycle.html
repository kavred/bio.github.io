                    <p>Carbon, the essence of life, constantly circulates through Earth's intricate systems. Plants, the primary producers, utilize sunlight, water, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in a process called photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 into sugars, fueling their growth and forming the base of the food web. As depicted in the diagram, carbon moves through the ecosystem as animals consume plants, transferring the organic carbon along the food chain. Respiration, the process by which organisms break down sugars for energy, releases CO2 back into the atmosphere. Simultaneously, decomposition by bacteria and fungi breaks down dead organisms and waste, returning carbon to the soil.
The carbon cycle also involves significant storage and exchange with other Earth systems. Oceans act as a major carbon sink, absorbing atmospheric CO2. Some of this carbon is used by marine organisms, while some is stored in deep ocean sediments. Fossil fuels, formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient organisms, represent a vast reservoir of stored carbon. However, the burning of fossil fuels releases this stored carbon as CO2 at an unprecedented rate, significantly impacting the cycle and driving climate change.</p>
