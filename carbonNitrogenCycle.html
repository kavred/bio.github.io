                    <p>Carbon, the essence of life, constantly circulates through Earth's intricate systems. Plants, the primary producers, utilize sunlight, water, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in a process called photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 into sugars, fueling their growth and forming the base of the food web. As depicted in the diagram, carbon moves through the ecosystem as animals consume plants, transferring the organic carbon along the food chain. Respiration, the process by which organisms break down sugars for energy, releases CO2 back into the atmosphere. Simultaneously, decomposition by bacteria and fungi breaks down dead organisms and waste, returning carbon to the soil.
The carbon cycle also involves significant storage and exchange with other Earth systems. Oceans act as a major carbon sink, absorbing atmospheric CO2. Some of this carbon is used by marine organisms, while some is stored in deep ocean sediments. Fossil fuels, formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient organisms, represent a vast reservoir of stored carbon. However, the burning of fossil fuels releases this stored carbon as CO2 at an unprecedented rate, significantly impacting the cycle and driving climate change.</p>

                    <p>Nitrogen, an essential element for plant growth and protein synthesis, also cycles through the environment in a complex process. As illustrated in the provided image, atmospheric nitrogen (N2), which is unusable by most organisms, is converted into usable forms through nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, found in soil and in the roots of some plants, convert N2 into ammonia (NH3). This ammonia is then further converted into ammonium (NH4+) through ammonification. Nitrification, carried out by nitrifying bacteria, converts ammonium into nitrite (NO2-) and then into nitrate (NO3-), the form of nitrogen most readily absorbed by plants.
Plants assimilate nitrates and ammonium, incorporating nitrogen into their tissues. Animals obtain nitrogen by consuming plants or other animals. When organisms die, decomposers break down organic matter, releasing ammonium back into the soil through ammonification. Denitrifying bacteria, under anaerobic conditions, convert nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen (N2), completing the cycle. Like the carbon cycle, human activities significantly impact the nitrogen cycle, primarily through the use of synthetic fertilizers.</p>
