                    <p>Deforestation, the clearing of forests for other land uses, significantly disrupts the carbon cycle. Forests serve as vital carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis. When trees are cut down, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, either immediately through burning or gradually as the organic matter decomposes. The loss of forests reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases and accelerating climate change.
Furthermore, deforestation often involves burning the cleared vegetation, which directly releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The decomposition of remaining organic matter in the soil also contributes to CO2 emissions. Beyond the immediate release of carbon, deforestation disrupts the long-term carbon sequestration potential of forests, further compromising the balance of the carbon cycle.</p>

                    <p>Fertilizers, while essential for agriculture, can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems when used excessively. Most fertilizers contain nitrogen, which, when applied in excess, runs off into nearby bodies of water. This influx of nitrogen can trigger algal blooms, characterized by rapid and excessive growth of algae. While algae are natural components of aquatic ecosystems, the overgrowth caused by fertilizer runoff disrupts the delicate balance.
Algal blooms have several negative consequences. They block sunlight from reaching submerged plants, hindering photosynthesis and oxygen production. When the algae die, their decomposition consumes large amounts of oxygen, leading to hypoxia or anoxia (low or no oxygen) in the water. This can create dead zones, where aquatic life cannot survive. Furthermore, some algal species produce toxins that can harm aquatic organisms and even humans.</p>

                    <p>Decomposers, including bacteria and fungi, play a crucial role in soil health and the nitrogen cycle. They break down dead organic matter, releasing nutrients, including nitrogen, back into the soil. This process, called ammonification, converts organic nitrogen into ammonia, which is then available for plants to use. Decomposers are essential for maintaining soil fertility and ensuring a continuous supply of nitrogen for plant growth. Without their activity, nitrogen would become locked up in organic matter, limiting its availability to plants and disrupting the entire nitrogen cycle.</p>
